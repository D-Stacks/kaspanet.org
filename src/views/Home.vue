        <h5>What is KASPA?</h5>
        <p>
            KASPA is an attempt at a proof-of-work cryptocurrency with instant confirmations and sub-second block times
            <br>
            It is based on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf" target="_blank">the PHANTOM protocol</a>, a generalization of Nakamoto consensus
        </p>

        <br>

        <h5>Is there a KASPA wallet?</h5>
        <p>
            At the moment, KASPA does not have a GUI wallet. You need to fully synchronize the node and use a set of programs that you can download from <a href="https://github.com/kaspanet/kaspad/releases/tag/v0.11.3" target="_blank">the github repository</a>
        </p>

        <br>

        <h5>How can I get Kaspa?</h5>
        <p>
            KASPA may be earned by using your computer's CPU to mine it or by exchanging it in the KASPA trade channel
            <br>
            KASPA hasn't been listed on any exchanges yet, remember that and don't let yourself be scammed
        </p>

        <br>

        <h5>Mining rewards</h5>
        <p>
            Today the average block reward is 500 KAS with a daily emission of 43M KAS
            <br>
            But a hard fork is already planned to engage deflationary monetary policy
