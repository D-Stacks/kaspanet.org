        <p>
            Kaspa is an attempt at a proof-of-work cryptocurrency with instant confirmations and sub-second block times
            <br>
            It is based on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf" target="_blank">the PHANTOM protocol</a>, a generalization of Nakamoto consensus

        <h5>Is there a Kaspa wallet?</h5>
        <p>
            At the moment, Kaspa does not have a GUI wallet. You need to fully synchronize the node and use a set of programs that you can download from <a href="https://github.com/kaspanet/kaspad/releases/tag/v0.11.3" target="_blank">the github repository</a>
        </p>
